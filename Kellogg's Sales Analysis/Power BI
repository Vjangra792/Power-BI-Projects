Kellogg's, also known as Kellanova, is an American multinational food manufacturing company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It produces cereal and convenience foods, including crackers and toaster pastries, and markets their products by several well-known brands including Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It.
 The company was founded by W.K. Kellogg, who discovered toasted flakes cereal and shaped an entire industry. Those toasted flakes became world-famous as Kellogg’s Corn Flakes®.

Kellogg's has a long history of innovation and has introduced several iconic products over the years, such as Bran Flakes, the first high-fiber cereal, and Special K®, the first cereal with seven vitamins and iron.
 The company has also expanded its product portfolio to include a wide range of convenience foods, snacks, and frozen breakfast items.

In recent years, Kellogg's has faced some challenges, including a recall of certain products due to an unusual smell and flavor from the packages' liners that could make people ill.
 Additionally, the company has been involved in various legal issues, including a lawsuit regarding the contents of its Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts.

Kellogg's is committed to sustainability and has taken steps to reduce its impact on the climate as part of its #BetterDays Promise.
 The company also focuses on corporate social responsibility, including supporting communities and fighting hunger through various initiatives.

In 2023, Kellogg's underwent a significant restructuring, separating into two independent companies: Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co. Kellanova focuses on global snacking, international cereal, and plant-based foods, while WK Kellogg Co focuses on North American cereal and frozen breakfast products.

The company continues to adapt and innovate, maintaining its position as a leader in the food industry.
